# Starbucks-Overlay

This is a fun Starbucks themed overlay that I made for The Bridge.

## Installation
To install the Starbucks Overlay, go over to https://github.com/StarbuckBarista/Starbucks-Overlay/releases and download the latest release. Once downloaded, move the ZIP file to your resource packs folder.

## Setup
In order for this overlay to work properly, you must be using Optifine. If you have Optifine, you need to make sure that you have a few important settings enabled. Navigate to **Video Settings** -> **Other**, make sure that **Connected Textures** is set to either **Fast** or **Fancy** and that **Custom Items** is set to **On**.

## Improvements
As this is still in development, feel free to leave any suggestions or fixes at https://github.com/StarbuckBarista/Starbucks-Overlay/issues.
